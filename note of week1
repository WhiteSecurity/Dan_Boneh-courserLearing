  cryptography is everywhere
security communication  
1.1 web traffic  : http 访问者和服务器  ssl/Tls  goal： NO eavesdropping and no tampering
     TLs is used to secure web traffic (secure Sockers Layer)
   Two main parts 
    A:Handshake Protocol: establish shated secret key using public-key cryptography
    B:Recoed Layer:Transmit data using shared secret key.Ensure confidentiality and integrity
 
 
1.2 wireless traffic: wpa2,GSM ,Bluetooth   
   
2. encrypting  files on disk   prevent the data form modifying and eavedropong  
    
3.content protection :  DVD css ; Blu-ray,AAcs
 
4. user authentication

single use key  email
multi use key 

cryptography is a tremendous tool and the bais for many security mechanisms 
disadvatage:
cryptography is not the solition to all security for example 1. software bug 2. society engineering attack
             reliable unless implemented and used properly

  What is the cryptography
    
    crypto core 
          1.sectet key establishment 
          2.secure communication  confidentiality and integrity
          
   for example applications
   1.digital signatures 
           how to make sure the source of the document 
     
   2.anonymous communication(mix net ) 
            want to talk  the doctor about the medical condition but don't want the doctor konw her name
            
   3.Anonymous digital cash
        the problem is that Alice spent the cash only once ,nobody will know the Alice's identity,but Alice spend twice ,all of the 
        a sudden her identity is completely exposed and then she could be subject to all sorts of legal problems 
        
   4.election  System  can compute the majority fo the votes but do it in such that nothing else is revealed about their individual votes 
   
   5.private autions  compute the winner of the highest bidder
   
   6.multi-party computation   6.1trusted authority 
   
   
                               6.2without the authority talk to each other and get a value of the function
   
   
   7.private outsourcing computation   Alice search query to google ,but google don't know who and what the query is 
   
   8. zero konwledge
   
   A rigorous science                             signature 
   1.precisely specify threat model               unfogy
   2.propose a construcion                          
   3.prove that breaking construction under threat mode  will solve an underlying hard problem

   The History of the cryptography
           symmetric ciphers
                             <The code breaker>
                             
   1. substitutuion cipher    
      caesar cipher  shift by 3   a--->d  b--->e................
         break: a: the key space is 26 factorial  but using the letter frequency is eaay to break it.
                     e is about 12.7%    
                     
                 b:use  frequency of pairs of letters
                     th    he 
                     
      vigene cipher  use the word as the key   add the key letters to the message letters ,modulo 26               
                  a: assume the length of the key1.....n

                      most famous :the Enigma (3-5 rotors) 
                      
       Data encryption Standard

    Discrete  probablity  离散概率 -----》(概率论) 
      def : probability distribution P over U is a function P:U---->[0,1]
        
        1.Uniform distribution for all x属于U:p(x)=1/|u|
        2.point distribution at X0: p(x0)=1,对于所有不等于x0的x，p(x)=0
        
     events
         发生某项事件的概率 For a set A属于U，P[A]是事件x的概率 这个A称为事件
         
     The union bound
         两个事件发生的概率小于等于两个时间发生概率之和
         
      Random variables  随机变量
         Def: a random Variable X is a function  X:U--->V
           
         
     The uniform random variable 
         随机事件发生的概率 ，
           1.deterministic algorithm:y<-----A(M)
           2.randomized algorithm ： y<------A(m;r) where r<-----{0,1}的n次幂
            r是一个隐式变量，每次进行一个随机算法会产生不同的output
             
   
    independence:    p[AB]=P[A]P[B] 两个事件相互独立 
    
         -------》XOR 
                  def：相同为0，不同为1 ，XOR has an important property 
                  
                  取两个相互独立的｛0，1｝的，一个是通过随机算法的得出·的，一个是符合均匀分布，结果相互异或， 将会得到一个均匀的随机变量
   
  proof 对于n=1 的时候 ｛0，1｝产生0的概率是p1,产生1的概率是p2，所以产生｛00｝和｛11｝的概率是
