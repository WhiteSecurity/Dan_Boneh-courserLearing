learning overview
        1.the inner workings of cryptography promitives and how to correctly use them
        2.how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions  
        3.how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications

organization       
       1.a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key whene facing powerful adversary and tampers with traffic 
       2.public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared sercet key
       
homework and grading 
        1.weekly problem and solve it within 8 hours 
        2.the language of  programming assignments is no-limitation 
        3.grade more than 80% is passing 
        4.final exam(no midterm)
        
free resourse to supplement the lecture

  cryptography is everywhere
security communication  
1.1 web traffic  : http 访问者和服务器  ssl/Tls  goal： NO eavesdropping and no tampering
     TLs is used to secure web traffic (secure Sockers Layer)
   Two main parts 
    A:Handshake Protocol: establish shated secret key using public-key cryptography
    B:Recoed Layer:Transmit data using shared secret key.Ensure confidentiality and integrity
 
 
1.2 wireless traffic: wpa2,GSM ,Bluetooth   
   
2. encrypting  files on disk   prevent the data form modifying and eavedropong  
    
3.content protection :  DVD css ; Blu-ray,AAcs
 
4. user authentication

single use key  email
multi use key 

cryptography is a tremendous tool and the bais for many security mechanisms 
disadvatage:
cryptography is not the solition to all security for example 1. software bug 2. society engineering attack
             reliable unless implemented and used properly
