  cryptography is everywhere
security communication  
1.1 web traffic  : http 访问者和服务器  ssl/Tls  goal： NO eavesdropping and no tampering
     TLs is used to secure web traffic (secure Sockers Layer)
   Two main parts 
    A:Handshake Protocol: establish shated secret key using public-key cryptography
    B:Recoed Layer:Transmit data using shared secret key.Ensure confidentiality and integrity
 
 
1.2 wireless traffic: wpa2,GSM ,Bluetooth   
   
2. encrypting  files on disk   prevent the data form modifying and eavedropong  
    
3.content protection :  DVD css ; Blu-ray,AAcs
 
4. user authentication

single use key  email
multi use key 

cryptography is a tremendous tool and the bais for many security mechanisms 
disadvatage:
cryptography is not the solition to all security for example 1. software bug 2. society engineering attack
             reliable unless implemented and used properly

  What is the cryptography
    
    crypto core 
          1.sectet key establishment 
          2.secure communication  confidentiality and integrity
          
   for example applications
   1.digital signatures 
           how to make sure the source of the document 
     
   2.anonymous communication(mix net ) 
            want to talk  the doctor about the medical condition but don't want the doctor konw her name
            
   3.Anonymous digital cash
        the problem is that Alice spent the cash only once ,nobody will know the Alice's identity,but Alice spend twice ,all of the 
        a sudden her identity is completely exposed and then she could be subject to all sorts of legal problems 
        
   4.election  System  can compute the majority fo the votes but do it in such that nothing else is revealed about their individual votes 
   
   5.private autions  compute the winner of the highest bidder
   
   6.multi-party computation   6.1trusted authority 
   
   
                               6.2without the authority talk to each other and get a value of the function
   
   
   7.private outsourcing computation   Alice search query to google ,but google don't know who and what the query is 
   
   8. zero konwledge
   
   A rigorous science                             signature 
   1.precisely specify threat model               unfogy
   2.propose a construcion                          
   3.prove that breaking construction under threat mode  will solve an underlying hard problem

   The History of the cryptography
           symmetric ciphers
                             <The code breaker>
                             
   1. substitutuion cipher    
      caesar cipher  shift by 3   a--->d  b--->e................
         break: a: the key space is 26 factorial  but using the letter frequency is eaay to break it.
                     e is about 12.7%    
                     
                 b:use  frequency of pairs of letters
                     th    he 
                     
      vigene cipher  use the word as the key   add the key letters to the message letters ,modulo 26               
                  a: assume the length of the key1.....n
